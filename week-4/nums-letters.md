Release 1: Summarize

What does puts do?
Puts returns nil and prints the output to the console with a new line. Puts does not pass on information, it only outputs the result to the console.

What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is a number without decimals (e.g. 2). A float is a number with decimals (e.g. 2.5).

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
The main difference between float and integer division is that if you divide to integers, the answer will always be an integer. For example, if you enter 9/2 into the console, the output would be 4. The answer is always rounded down. If two floats are divided, the output will be a float. For example, 9/2 would result in 4.5. It is also important to note that if one of the numbers in a float, the output will be a float. For example, if you enter 9.0/2, the output will be 4.5 because 9.0 is a float.

Reflection

How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
Ruby handles arithmeic operations in a similar manner as a calculator.  The computer recognizes the operators and then executes accordingly.  It is beneficial to assign a number to a variable, so you can use the variable in your code and adjust your numbers accordingly.

What is the difference between integers and floats?
An integer is a number without decimal points (eg 5).  A float is a number with decimal points (eg 5.25).

What is the difference between integer and float division?
In integer divison, the answer will be given as an integer.  If the exact answer is not a whole number, the number will be rounded down as the solution.  In float division, the answer will be given as a float.  It is helpful to note that only one of the numbers needs to be a float for the computer to return the answer as a float.

What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
A string is a group of letters or numbers in a program that are surrounded by quotes. You would use strings when you would like to output a word or sentence.

What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
Local variables are variables that are specific to the particule file you are working in.  They have been defined in the file and cannot be used in a different directory.  Local variables are used when you would like to assign a variable to a string, number or boolean and incorporate into a method.  Variables help to keep the code clean and allow the user to change the value of the variable at any time.  This allows the code to remain the same and adjust the result based on the given variables.

How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
I liked this challenge because it was my first introduction into testing.  It was difficult in the beginning to get everything set up properly but I enjoyed working through the errors and solving them.  I feel that I have an understanding of the basics and can build upon what I learned in the past.
