  source.dup # This line is here to make sure all tests initially fail. Delete it when you begin coding.

# Person 5
def my_array_splitting_method(source)
  source.partition { |item| item.class == Fixnum}
end

def my_hash_splitting_method(source, age)
 source.partition { |pet, age| age <= 4}
end

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# The Ruby method I implemented to solve this challenge was the partition method.  The partition method creates two arrays, where you specify what the first array should consist of and the remaining is put into the other array. For the array, I researched the .class method, which allows you to test the object type (Fixnum, String, Object).


# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
# During my research, I learned about the importance of taking things slow and thinking through the different options and how they will manipulate an object. I also learned about researching very specific aspects of the code you are trying to solve and then incorporate into the larger code.  I enjoy explaining my research process because it allows me to reflect on my researching style and make changes in the future.
