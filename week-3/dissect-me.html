What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

The main HTML5 tags I used in this challenge were DOCTYPE, html, head, title, meta (for charset), and body. I continue to return to these tags often because they are the basic building blocks of any html code. It is helpful to have the base set up and then add to the code as needed.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Elements get laid out on a page from top to bottom, The browers will follow the structure of the code, starting with the information in the head (to define meta tags/title) and then move down to the body, where the main contenct of the webpage lives. If tags are nested inside of one another, the browser will display those elements and then move down to the large tag, following the same process.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I learned that it is possible to create templates in Sublime via snippets. It is an easy way to set up a basic template that would be needed for any code you begin to write. This is helpful because it helps save time and ensures that you do not forget the most important aspects of the code structure. I plan to continue creating more snippets as I continue to learn about code. The existing shortcuts are also helpful and I plan to take advantage of these in the future.
