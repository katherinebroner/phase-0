<!--

 - What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

  Magic! I enjoyed seeing how I could use what I learned in the lessons being applied to an actual website. I enjoyed that this challenge was a hands-on experience to test the code.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

  We used html5doctor.com and the John Duckett HTML and CSS book for reference. Specifically, we looked up the horizontal rule tag <hr />.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

  We did well at keeping to best practices and focused on building the basic structure of the website. I am seeing how it is important to set up the skeleton of the website before adding formatting/CSS attributes.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

  Good: Very useful when needing to create the backbone of the site. Most of the tags are self explanatory - eg. head, title, body, img.
  Bad: The HTML code is a bit clunky. Even for a small website, you need to enter in a lot of tags. It can be confusing at times because not all tags need to be closed.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

  Check to make sure you have closing tags typed in. Like a person, you start at the head and move down to the body. Indenting the code for new tags helps to keep things organized.
