# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

I learned about three main time management and productivity ideas.  First, was the Pomodoro Technique, which consists of working on one task for 25 minutes and then taking a 5 minute break.  Second, was the Fogg Method, which consists of picking a specific behavior that is easy to do on a regular basis.  Lastly, is the productivity idea of "Time Boxing".  "Time Boxing" is when you set a previously agreed period of time for working towards a specific goal.  Once time is reached, you review the progress of your work.  This is a beneficial strategy because it allows you to overcome procrastination, conquer perfectionism, increase efficiency, and plug time sinks (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram).  I can use this strategy in Phase 0 by applying the Pomodoro Technique of 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of rest when working through the different assignments.  This will allow me to stay fresh and work on each assignment with a clear head.  Currently, I manage my time by having a general schedule planned for when I would like to complete certain tasks, however; it is not set in stone so I have room for flexibility.  My current strategy works because I specifically designate time to work on tasks to avoid completing everything at the last minute.  One way my current strategy does not work is that I do not have a set plan once I start working and can easily get distracted, which lessens my efficiency.  I plan to employ the "Time Boxing" strategy in conjunction with the Pomodoro Technique as I continue working through the program.  Having more structured time will allow me to work more efficiently and spend time evaluating my progress.  My overall plan for Phase 0 time management is to spread out my assignments throughout the week and set a time limit when working on exercises.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

1.  A shell allows the user to access the computers operating systems.  "Bash" allows you to execute commands in the shell in order to create new directories, move directories, list directories, etc.

2.  The most challenging part for me going through the material was following the shell video.  I found it difficult to follow the steps and understand what was trying to be achieved during each section.  The video felt more advanced than being able to provide a basic introduction to bash commands.

3.  I was able to successfully use all of the commands on my Terminal.  I created a test directory in order to practice the commands we have been taught.

4.  In my opinion, the most important arguments are pwd, ls, cd, mkdir, rmdir, and touch because they allow you to navigate the Terminal and create the basic building blocks of a structured program.

5.  pwd: print working directory; ls: list directory/file; mv: move/rename a file/directory; cd: change to a different directory; ../: move to the previous directory (one above the current directory); touch: create an empty text file; mkdir: create a new directory; less: view a text file in the Terminal; rmdir: remove a directory; rm: remove a file; help: find information about a command.
