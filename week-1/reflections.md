# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

I learned about three main time management and productivity ideas.  First, was the Pomodoro Technique, which consists of working on one task for 25 minutes and then taking a 5 minute break.  Second, was the Fogg Method, which consists of picking a specific behavior that is easy to do on a regular basis.  Lastly, is the productivity idea of "Time Boxing".  "Time Boxing" is when you set a previously agreed period of time for working towards a specific goal.  Once time is reached, you review the progress of your work.  This is a beneficial strategy because it allows you to overcome procrastination, conquer perfectionism, increase efficiency, and plug time sinks (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram).  I can use this strategy in Phase 0 by applying the Pomodoro Technique of 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of rest when working through the different assignments.  This will allow me to stay fresh and work on each assignment with a clear head.  Currently, I manage my time by having a general schedule planned for when I would like to complete certain tasks, however; it is not set in stone so I have room for flexibility.  My current strategy works because I specifically designate time to work on tasks to avoid completing everything at the last minute.  One way my current strategy does not work is that I do not have a set plan once I start working and can easily get distracted, which lessens my efficiency.  I plan to employ the "Time Boxing" strategy in conjunction with the Pomodoro Technique as I continue working through the program.  Having more structured time will allow me to work more efficiently and spend time evaluating my progress.  My overall plan for Phase 0 time management is to spread out my assignments throughout the week and set a time limit when working on exercises.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

1.  A shell allows the user to access the computers operating systems.  "Bash" allows you to execute commands in the shell in order to create new directories, move directories, list directories, etc.

2.  The most challenging part for me going through the material was following the shell video.  I found it difficult to follow the steps and understand what was trying to be achieved during each section.  The video felt more advanced than being able to provide a basic introduction to bash commands.

3.  I was able to successfully use all of the commands on my Terminal.  I created a test directory in order to practice the commands we have been taught.

4.  In my opinion, the most important arguments are pwd, ls, cd, mkdir, rmdir, and touch because they allow you to navigate the Terminal and create the basic building blocks of a structured program.

5.  pwd: print working directory; ls: list directory/file; mv: move/rename a file/directory; cd: change to a different directory; ../: move to the previous directory (one above the current directory); touch: create an empty text file; mkdir: create a new directory; less: view a text file in the Terminal; rmdir: remove a directory; rm: remove a file; help: find information about a command.

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

How to Create a New Repo: 1) Log in to your GitHub account.  2) Select the "+" sign at the top right to create a new repository.  3)  On "Create a new repository" page, type in the repo name, select public or private, and other specifications.  Then, click create repo!

How to Fork a Repo: 1)  Navigate to the repository you would like to have copied over to your GitHub account.  You will need to fork the repo over from the original source of the data.  2)  Click the Fork button in the top right and select your GitHub account.  The repo will then be forked into your GitHub and ready to work on!

How to Clone a Repo:  1) Log in to your GitHub account and click on the repo you would like to clone onto your local machine.  This will bring you to the specific page of that repository.  2)  In the middle of the screen, copy the HTTPS link (this will connect the repo in your GitHub account to your local machine).  3)  Navigate to your Terminal and go to the directory where you would like to clone in this repository.  4)  Once in the proper directory, type git clone <paste URL that was copied from GitHub>.  5)  After executing, you will be able to see that the repo has been cloned onto your computer.

A programmer would choose to fork a repository when they would like to work on code that has already been written by another user.  This allows the programmer to copy over a working version of the code to their local account and make edits and changes without affecting the master branch of the code.  Forking over a repository is much quicker than writing a new repository, especially when the code base has already been completed.

I did not have any major struggles setting up git and GitHub since I have worked with both applications in the past.  This allowed me to feel more comfortable moving through the steps and continue advancing my knowledge and comfort level with using both git and GitHub.  One thing I need to be cautious of when cloning over a repository from my GitHub account is to ensure that I am in the proper directory in my Terminal.  I learned that it is important to have very specific directories so you can easily navigate to your various repositories.
