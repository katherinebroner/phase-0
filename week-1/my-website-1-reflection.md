Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

To create a repository in GitHub, you will first click the "+" sign in the top right and select "Create a new repository".  Next, type in the name of your repository.  Choose whether you would like the repository to be public or private, initialize with a README and a specific license if you choose.  Then, click "Create repository."  Once the repository has been created, click into that specific repository in your GitHub account.  Copy the HTTPS link in the middle of the screen. Move to your local machine and navigate to where you would like this repository to sit.  Once there, type in the commmand - git clone <paste HTTPS URL here>.  After you execute the code, you repository has been cloned.

Describe what open source means.

Open source means that your code can be freely used, modified, and shared within the programming community.  Open sourcing your code allows you to work on the same code with different people.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think that Open Source is an excellent way to learn from others and discover new programming techniques.  I also think it is a great way to get helpful feedback on your code and contribute to your growth as a developer.  However, it does make me slightly nervous that there is the possibilty of others taking credit for the original code I have written.  There is a sense of pride when writing successful code and I do not want to lose that in the open source community.  While it does feel like utopia, I think it is important to find a healthy balance between sharing ideas and protecting the integrity of the code.

Assess the importance of using licenses.

It is important to use licenses because it allows you to set specific permissions around your code.  You can choose to be strict with who has the ability to change and share your code or you can choose to be more open.  There are many different licenses to choose from, which allows each developer to pick the level of protection they would like.  Licenses allow you hold the copyright on your work, but still give you the ability to be part of the open source community.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

The main concepts solidified in this challenge was creating a feature branch before beginning to work on code.  I am being careful to make sure I do this each time so that I can keep the master branch clean.  The concept of staging and committing my code has also been solidified.  In addition, I also feel more comfortable creating pull requests in GitHub and updating the changes on my local machine.  The "aha" moment I have experienced is when I complete a full pull request and see how the information changes in GitHub as well as my local machine.  I enjoy going through each step of the process and see the changes that are being made.  I also like that I am learning how to keep my repositiories clean and easy to navigate.  One area I struggled with in the beggining was forgetting to create the feature branch before working on my code.  I am now seeing the importance of taking my time to make sure that my repositories remain organized and the master branch stays clean.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I found StackOverflow helpful when there was a random question I could not find in the slides or my notes.  I am happy to see that there are so many resources available online.  The videos and readings provided in assignements are extremely helpful and I enjoy both reading about the topics and watching how it is completed on the computer.
